This repository is an attempt to implement all kind of widely used Algorithms and Data Structures in the programming world. I hope it helps you get ready for your next big Technical Interview. 

I will be maintaining each algorithm and data structure in its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading.

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design. Creating and designing excellent algorithms is required for being an exemplary programmer.
